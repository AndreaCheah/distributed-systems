## How to run
In the parent directory, run `go run question_number / question_number.go` to see the output for each question.  
For example, to see the output for Question 1.1, run `go run 1_1/1_1.go`.

## To note
Question 1 is complete.  
Question 2 is incomplete. Only Question 2.1 is attempted.
- For Question 2.1, the coordinator can successfully send sync messages and the nodes can successfully synchonise. Fault detection through timeout is implemented. The election process is partially implemented.
